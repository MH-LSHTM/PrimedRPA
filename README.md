# PrimedRPA

This is a commanline tool for the creation and filtering of primer and exo probe sets for use in Recombinase Polymerase Amplification as described here: https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty701/5068159

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

The PrimedRPA tool is dependent on several packages and programs which are outlined below:

- Clustal Omega (Download from: http://www.clustal.org/omega/)
- Python 3.6  
- Pandas 0.20.3
- sys 3.6.3
- Bio 1.70

## Installation

Installation steps

```
git clone https://github.com/MH-LSHTM/PrimedRPA.git
cd PrimedRPA

#Make file executable
chmod +x ./PrimedRPA.py

#Save path to file
Path=$(pwd)

FileName="/PrimedRPA.py'"

aliastext="alias PrimedRPA='"

#Create full path with name
Fullpath=${aliastext}${Path}${FileName}

# Copy bashrc to back it up
cp ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc_prior_PrimedRPA

# Create alias for PrimedRPA
echo $Fullpath >> ~/.bashrc

# Copy bashrc to back it up
cp ~/.bash_profile ~/.bashrc_profile_PrimedRPA

# Create alias for PrimedRPA
echo $Fullpath >> ~/.bash_profile

```
## PrimedRPA Overview

## Test Run

Within the cloned repositry there is a directory named Test. Within this directory there is a pre-configurated PrimedRPA_Parameters.txt file alongside a test fasta sequence. Navigate into this directory and run the command:

```
PrimedRPA PrimedRPA_Parameters.txt
```
If all dependancies are install the program shall run and the follow output should be obtained:
